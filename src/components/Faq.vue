                answer: `<p class="text-[#1c1c1c] text-lg mb-4 leading-7">Mindfulness is a practice that involves intentionally bringing one's attention and awareness to the present moment without judgment. It's about being fully present and engaged in the here and now, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness encourages a non-judgmental attitude towards one's thoughts, emotions and sensations, allowing them to arise and pass without any added stress. By cultivating mindfulness, people often develop a greater sense of clarity, calmness and overall wellbeing, as well as enhance their ability to respond skillfully to the challenges of life.</p>`

                answer: `<p class="text-[#1c1c1c] text-lg mb-4 leading-7">Although it's commonly known now that there are different 'colors' of noises, it might not be known what the difference between them are. Different types of noise have distinct frequency characteristics, which means that the energy of the sound is distributed differently across the frequency spectrum. As a result, how you perceive each noise can affect the use-case of each frequency.</p><p>White noise has equal power in every frequency band, between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz, and gives your brain something relaxing to focus on; this can help block out distractions and make it perfect for sleep. Similarly, brown noise has more energy at lower frequencies, giving it a deep, 'booming' noise. It is commonly used for relaxation and sleep.</p><p>Pink noise has less energy at higher frequencies. Pink noise is often described as having a "fuller" sound compared to white noise. Naturally occurring examples of pink noise are rustling leaves, wind, and heartbeats.</p><p>Lastly, it is theorized that green noise is calming because it simulates the spectrum of natural noise without human-made noises; this noise has more energy at mid-range frequencies and is sometimes used in sound masking for tinnitus.</p>`

                answer: `<p class="text-[#1c1c1c] text-lg mb-4 leading-7">Binaural beats are a type of sound therapy that involves playing two different tones in each ear, creating a perceived beat frequency that is thought to affect brain waves. The idea is that when the brain hears two slightly different frequencies, it tries to "reconcile" them by producing a third frequency that is the difference between the two. This is known as the "frequency following response," and it is believed to influence brain waves in a way that can be beneficial for focus and relaxation.</p><p>Some research suggests that listening to binaural beats can help improve focus and reduce anxiety by promoting a state of relaxation and reducing stress levels. One theory is that binaural beats can influence the production of alpha waves in the brain, which are associated with relaxation and reduced anxiety.</p><p>Another theory is that binaural beats can help entrain the brain to a specific frequency associated with improved focus or creativity. For example, some studies have suggested that listening to binaural beats in the alpha or theta frequency range can help improve cognitive performance and enhance creativity.</p><p>However, while some research has shown potential benefits of binaural beats for certain conditions, such as anxiety and depression, the evidence is not yet conclusive.</p>`
